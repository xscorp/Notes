# The Secret Teachings of the Vedas

## Material Happiness
* [Bhagwad Geeta (Chapter 5 Verse 22)](https://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/5/verse/22)
  ```
  ये हि संस्पर्शजा भोगा दु:खयोनय एव ते |
  आद्यन्तवन्त: कौन्तेय न तेषु रमते बुध: ||
  ```
  The pleasures that arise from contact with the sense objects, though appearing as enjoyable to worldly-minded people, are verily a source of misery. O son of Kunti, such pleasures have a beginning and an end, and so the wise do not delight in them.


* [Bhagavad Geeta (Chapter 2 Verse 63)](https://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/2/verse/63)
  ```
  क्रोधाद्भवति सम्मोह: सम्मोहात्स्मृतिविभ्रम: |
  स्मृतिभ्रंशाद् बुद्धिनाशो बुद्धिनाशात्प्रणश्यति ||
  ```
  What happens when one works for material sense gratification is explained as follows: “While contemplating the objects of the senses, a person develops
attachment to them, and from such attachment lust develops, and from lust anger arises. From anger, delusion arises, and from delusion bewilderment of memory.
When memory is bewildered, intelligence is lost, and when intelligence is lost, one falls down again into the material pool.”


* [Bhagwad Geeta (Chapter 2 Verse 14)](https://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/2/verse/14)
  ```
  मात्रास्पर्शास्तु कौन्तेय शीतोष्णसुखदु: खदा: |
  आगमापायिनोऽनित्यास्तांस्तितिक्षस्व भारत ||
  ```
  O son of Kunti, the contact between the senses and the sense objects gives rise to fleeting perceptions of happiness and distress. These are non-permanent, and come and go like the winter and summer seasons. O descendent of Bharat, one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.


* [Bhagwad Geeta (Chapter 2 Verse 70)](https://www.holy-bhagavad-gita.org/chapter/2/verse/70)
  ```
  आपूर्यमाणमचलप्रतिष्ठं
  समुद्रमाप: प्रविशन्ति यद्वत् |
  तद्वत्कामा यं प्रविशन्ति सर्वे
  स शान्तिमाप्नोति न कामकामी ||
  ```
  As long as we have this body, we will naturally have various desires. We cannot really stop them. However, the body will one day be finished and all things related to the body will also be finished.
Ultimately, when the body dies, it is buried and deteriorates into earth, or is burned and becomes ashes, or it is eaten by others, such as animals and insects,
and becomes stool. For earth, stool, or ashes we are taking so much care, and for that we are in so much anxiety. For what reason? Because we are attached to this
body and our desires. Therefore, it is stated: “A person who is not disturbed by the incessant flow of desires that enter like rivers into the ocean which is ever
being filled but is always still can alone achieve peace, and not the man who strives to satisfy such desires.”
