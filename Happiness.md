### Keep silent! Only speak when you are sure your words count.

### Stop comparing your life to their's Shashank. You have a nice and well paid job to enjoy life comfortably and to buy shit they can't! You are such a young achiever! They might be getting emotional support at this moment, but remember, the Nature will break them one day so that they can learn their lesson and be strong. But you have already gone through it. You have already achieved how to make peace with sadness.

### Dear Shashank, You also have a loving family that genuinely cares for you and do not care about whether or not you have a job or nice dressing sense or nice humor. They support and love you unconditionally. There are people in InfoSec community that respect you and look up to you, they wanna be a great learner like you! Yes, you are great! Also, you have street dogs who rely on you, who get mad happy when they see you. Even if you leave them for sometime, they will still expcet you to show up. They trust you!
